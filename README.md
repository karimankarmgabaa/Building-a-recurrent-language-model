# Building-a-recurrent-language-model
A language model can predict the probability of the next word in the sequence, based  on the words already observed in the sequence. In this problem, we will need to prepare  text for developing a word-based language model, design and fit a neural language model  with a learned embedding and a recurrent hidden layer, and to use the learned language model to generate new text with similar statistical properties as the source text.
